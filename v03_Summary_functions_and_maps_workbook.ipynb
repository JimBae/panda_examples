    "You have learned how to select relevant data from `DataFrame` and `Series` objects. Plucking the right data out of our data representation is critical to getting work done.\n",

    "The remainder of this tutorial will cover different operations we can apply to our data to get the input \"just right\". We'll start off in this section by looking at the most commonly looked built-in reshaping operations. Along the way we'll cover data `dtypes`, a concept essential to working with `pandas` effectively.\n",
